<blockquote>
<p>Live in the future, then build what&rsquo;s missing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Montaigne, who in 1580 published a book of what he called &ldquo;essais.&rdquo; He was doing something quite different from what lawyers do, and the difference is embodied in the name.  Essayer is the French verb meaning &ldquo;to try&rdquo; and an essai is an attempt.  An essay is something you write to try to figure something out.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Interest is much more unevenly distributed than ability. If natural ability is all you need to do great work, and natural ability is evenly distributed, you have to invent elaborate theories to explain the skewed distributions we see among those who actually do great work in various fields. But it may be that much of the skew has a simpler explanation: different people are interested in different things.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit strange that you have to play mind games with yourself to avoid being discouraged by lame-looking early efforts. The thing you&rsquo;re trying to trick yourself into believing is in fact the truth. A lame-looking early version of an ambitious project truly is more valuable than it seems. So the ultimate solution may be to teach yourself that.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps if you study enough such cases, you can teach yourself to be a better judge of early work. Then you&rsquo;ll be immune both to other people&rsquo;s skepticism and your own fear of making something lame. You&rsquo;ll see early work for what it is.</p>
