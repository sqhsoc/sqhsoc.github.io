<pre><code>* Effective rituals
    * where you will work and for how long
    * how you will work once you start to work
    * how you will support your work (ie. where to get energy, go for a walk, etc)
* Set goal with passion, keep a scoreboard for progress, accountability
* The typical workday is eight hours. The most adept deep thinker cannot spend more than four of these hours in a state of true depth.
* If I stumble onto an important insight, then this is a perfectly valid reason to ignore the rest of my schedule for the day.
* Tasks that leverage your expertise tend to be deep tasks and they can therefore provide a double benefit: They return more value per time spent, and they stretch your abilities, leading to improvement. On the other hand, a task that our hypothetical college graduate can pick up quickly is one that does not leverage expertise, and therefore it can be understood as shallow.
* “Sorry I can’t join your committee, but I’m happy to take a look at some of your proposals as they come together and offer my thoughts”. A clean break is best.
* As a graduate student at MIT, I had the opportunity to interact with famous academics. In doing so, I noticed that many shared a fascinating and somewhat rare approach to e-mail: Their default behavior when receiving an e-mail message is to not respond. It’s the sender’s responsibility to convince the receiver that a reply is worthwhile.
