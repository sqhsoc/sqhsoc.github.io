                <p>Siqi Han is an <a href="https://www.soc.cuhk.edu.hk/profile/han-siqi/">assistant professor of sociology</a> at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. She is also associated with CUHK&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.soc.cuhk.edu.hk/research/research-clusters/computational-social-science/">computational social science cluster</a>. Before joining CUHK she was a postdoctoral research scholar on the Measuring the Liberal Arts project at <a href="https://incite.columbia.edu/measuring-liberal-arts/">INCITE</a>, Columbia University. She received her PhD in Sociology from The Ohio State University. Her work mainly focuses on knowledge structure in higher education, school to work transition, and labor market skill returns. She addresses her research questions using both surveys and unstructured textual data with computationally-intensive quantitative methods. These projects appeared in Journal of Marriage and Family, Social Science Research, Sociological Perspectives, European Sociological Review, Socius, and other academic journals.</p>
<p>Siqi is open to working with prospective graduate students who are interested in inequalities in higher education, the labor market, and the academia. Having basic understandings of and/or experiences with textual analysis is a plus. A few ongoing projects of hers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge cross-fertilization in college curriculum</li>
<li>College experiences and their long term impacts on economic and non-economic wellbeing</li>
<li>Changing Labor market skill demands in the context of the fourth industrialization</li>
</ul>
